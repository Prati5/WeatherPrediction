# WeatherPrediction
Weather prediction using python.
Weather forecasting is the task of predicting the state of the atmosphere at a future time and a speciÔ¨Åed location.
There are many types of machine learning algorithms to predict the weather, of which two most important algorithms in predicting the weather are Linear Regression and a variation of Functional Regression. These models are trained based on the historical data provided of any location. Input to these models are provided such as if predicting temperature, then minimum
temperature, mean atmospheric pressure, maximum temperature, mean humidity, and classification for 2 days.
